# CS3520

This repository consists of my indivdual projects from my CS3520 (Programming in C++) class at Northeastern. This class teaches the basics of C++ including scoping, typing, and primitive data types. 
Each program can be compiled and run using either clang++ or g++ unless stated otherwise.
